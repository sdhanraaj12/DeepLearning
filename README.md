# Neural Networks and Deep Learning

## Neural networks
its a beautiful biologically-inspired programming paradigm which enables a computer to learn from observational data
## Deep learning
Its a powerful set of techniques for learning in neural networks

### Neural networks and deep learning currently provide the best solutions to many problems in image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Here we will see many of the core concepts behind neural networks and deep learning.
